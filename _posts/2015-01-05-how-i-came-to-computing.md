title: How I came to Computing
---

I have been using computers since Windows were a thing you broke (not that much has changed). I remember the Christmas that my father bought Windows 95, being excited to install the brand new MechWarrior with actual color graphics that could run on the first ever Pentium processor, wondering how I would ever fill up the 100 MB hard drive.

I started programming in earnest during my Computer Science classes in high school - it seemed a natural fit, solving puzzles with a combination of math and words, so I chose it as a college major. After graduating with a Computer Engineer degree from the University of Florida, I went to work at Sage Software - maintenance and development on a C# EMR (Electronic Medical Records) application. I saw firsthand the problems that computing and algorithms could solve: maintaining complex webs of medical information as it related to various systems, like vaccination schedules and medical contraindications. I also saw the problems they could create: overly-complex systems of unmaintainable code, wherein one change could have drastic effects on something very real - a patient's life! 

While at Sage, I also learned that software did not need to be complex to solve a problem. It could solve a simple problem, like extra whitespace in received client data, that added hours to someone's workflow. It could set and reset complex and intricate development environments without worry of forgetting one component. In short, the first sign of quality code is that it works!
